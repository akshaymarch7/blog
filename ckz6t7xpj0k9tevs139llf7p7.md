keep ONLY interview-related open 😬  

6. Keep your phone's hotspot on, you never know 📶  
7. Tell everyone at your home that you've a meeting 🙂  
8. Login 5 minutes before (very important) ✅  

9. Speak out loud a few Tongue-Twisters,  
it's a great speaking exercise for clear speech 😇  
10. Keep the video ON, it's highly underrated.   
It adds an extra level to your communication (very important) 😍  

11. Get a smile on the face, a BIG one, 😁

12. Close your eyes, take a very very very deep breath 😌  

13. As soon as you open your eyes,  
100% `undivided attention` on the call,  
100% `undivided focus` 🔥  

14. As soon as the interviewer joins,  
make the FIRST MOVE, 🔥  
greet him, "Hi Akshay, Good Morning!",  
with a BIG smile on your face. 😊  

And,
Smile is `contagious` 🤷🏽‍♂️  
The interviewer will 100% smile back & greet you too 😇  

So now you're friends 😅  
All the nervousness is gone,  
and trust me,  
you'll feel `very very comfortable`! 💚


Trust me,
