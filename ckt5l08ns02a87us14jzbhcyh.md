## Graphic Designing Competition ðŸš€

A lot of people who love my videos have asked me to start an online merch store.
Finally, I decided to start one, but I suck at graphic designing. ðŸ¥º

I need help from the Graphic Designers in my network to come up with creative print designs. These designs will be printed on T-shirts, hoodies, and other products!

Hereby, announcing the **Graphic Designing Competition!** *~ drumrolls ~* ðŸ¥³

The products will be for developers(mostly Indians), so the designs should be: 
- Geeky - Desi - Techie - Minimalistic - Creative

**Ideas:**

I've few ideas in my mind to print on the products: 

- **Namaste JavaScript**   
This is the name of the most popular video series on my Youtube Channel, people love this a lot. Would love to get `Namaste JavaScript` printed in a desi+tech way on schwag!
- **Time, tide and JavaScript waits for none**  
This is the most famous quote from Namaste JavaScript series, a lot of my Youtube subscribers have already requested this to be printed on a tee. 
- **undefined**  or **swag++** or any other 1-2 word print   
Simple, plain, minimalistic wordplay with a geeky word or 2-word, we can play with fonts and colors and aesthetic to make it look cool
- **Itni shakti hume dena DATA**  
Haha, this would be a witty line to which all Engineers will be able to relate to.

- **Any creative technical line**  
This is open, you can come up with your own unique creative ideas, just make sure they are geeky. It could be funny, witty, motivating, or anything from Namaste JS also.
